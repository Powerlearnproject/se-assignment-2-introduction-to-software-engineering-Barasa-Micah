Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the process of developing,testing and deploying computer applications to solve real world problems by following a set of engineering principles and best practices.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering has a broader perspective than traditional programming. Traditional prpgramming only focuses on writing code 
Software engineering involves not only coding but also system architecture, analysis, testing and project management while traditional prpgramming only involves modules within software applications without looking at the whole system. It does not look at the overall design and its architecture.
In software engineering one may develop operating syatem for computers, game consoles and others but in traditional programming one comes upwith code only without designing the entire systems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirements
It involves collecting and documenting the system requirements and user needs and converting the collected information into clear requiremnts ready for develpoment
2. Design 
The original plan is turned into software design document which includes system design, programming language, platforms one uses and other designs. Detailed design of the software architecture and user interface is created.
3. Implementation 
Software requirement is converted into code that makes the product. It also involves building the software according to the design created.
4. Testing
Here the software product is tested before it is released to the live environment. This is done to ensure it works well and it meets quality starndards. It also helps solve major user experience issues and security issues.
5. Deployment
The final product is delivered to the intended user. One can use a small number of users first and tests can be repeated to ensure everything is secure and working properly.
6. Maintenance
Updates and enhancements of the software is conducted. New features may also be added and bugs that were missed earlier can be fixed.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
1. Similarities
Both of them perform same activities, collecting requirements, designing, developing, testing and deploying.
Both involve planning, executing and monitoring project's process.
They value individuals and intereactions and user collaboration and they respond to change.
They have similar goals i.e to produce high quality software applications and make users contanted and happy.
2. Differences
Agile model us continuous lifecycle to develop software while waterfall isa linear sequential model.
In Agile, development is divided into sprints while in watwerfall process is broken down into different phases.
Agile is flexible to chhanges at any time and development process while in Waterfall it is difficult and costly to make changes.
For Agile delivery time is short while in Waterfall delivery time is long because entire project must be completed before delivery.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

It is the area that deals with process of developing and verifying system requirements. The requirements are docemented after establishing them.
In the process, we start with the need for something, mmaybe a new product or research. Then comes eliciation which involves getting the need from stakeholders. After this analysis is done to translate the data collected during eliciation into information that makes sense to users and also makes business sense.It is here that Requirements are written.Then there is negotiation oftenly done in large projects that not all stakeholders agree to requirements. After this comes the documentation then the validation which is done in proofing the documentation and going through all the documentation sent.
The importance is that it reduces project risks through forward planning so that the software meets user expectations during its production.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity aims at developing a software in a way that dependencies are minimised among the components of a system. It also allows complex software to be manageable for maintenance and implementation.
It improves maintainability and scalability by:
Breaking down software into independent modules which can be easily adapted, extended and some parts can be replaced without affecting the remaining parts.
It also allows paralel development and enhances collaboration.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing
Involves tests for a single unit and is performed by the developer. Primary goal is to check performance of unit components. This helps to in detecting errors early and therefore reduces software development risks.
2. Integration testing
Different units, modules or components of a software application are tested together.
3. System testing
It is most likely the final test to ensure the system meets the required specifications. The system is tested as a whole to ensure overall product meets the requirements.
4. Acceptance testing
Evaluates whether software meets the end user requirements and tests if it is ready for deployment. It also finds out how the software will operate when installed on the users system.
 The different levels of testing are important since they identify problems and issues with written code and they are fixed before software is delivered.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
They are software toolsthat aid managing changes to source code over time.
They are impoertant since they encourage pre-review, collaboration leading to improved code quqlity. 
It also helps to ensure up-to-date and accurate documents are used.Examples include git, subversion, mercurial.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Planning everything from execution to delivery to maximise output while minimizing input.
Oversee the software development team and collaborate with software developers, web designers, graphic designers to ensure that people are working together towards the same goal.
Delegating work effectively.
Monitoring progress and tracking problems to ensure that work is going on as planned.
Managing the deployment deliveries.
The challenges faced may include:
Poor communication between members causing misunderstandings and leads to poor outcomes and delays completion of projects.
Lack of accountability in memebers can be challenging in finishing the project.
Poor budgeting and therefore project managers can be asked to make do with the available resources even if they are not available.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
This is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
Corrective maintenance which involves fixing defects.
Adaptive which involves adapting to the environment perfective which entails the enhancing of different attributes. 
Preventive maintenance which involves preventing problems from occurring.
It is important because it ensures modification and updating of software applications after the deployment process and helps to fix bugs and improves performance of the system.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Weak security. Softawre industry is prone to security issues.
Algorithm bias in that computers cannot undertand morality.
Unethical data collection.
Ethical standards can be adhered by:
Accessing the ethical implications of software's suppose and fuctionality ensuring it doesn't harm individuals and ensures it does not lead to or encourage discrimination.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
